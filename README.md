## Cavets

Incomplete, highly opnionated and biased due to my own experiences.
There are arguably much 'better', more comprehensive, more objective and more authoritive collections of resources out there. See below for some examples:

 [Chris Kenst's resources](https://www.kenst.com/resources/)
 
 [The Rapid Software Testing methodlogy bibilographies](https://www.satisfice.com/resources)
 
 [The Association for Software Testers syndicated blog](https://associationforsoftwaretesting.org/blog/)
 
 [The Ministry of Testing Dojo catalog](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/catalog)
